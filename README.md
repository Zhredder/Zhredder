<h2>üîç Ongoing Initiatives</h2>

- Working on my problem solving skills (Check out my hackerrank)
- Going through the odin project/updating projects. 
- I use a pomodoro timer while I am working. However, the ones that are found online are quite limited in their functionality. So I am building a more advanced version of the timer, with more capabilities.
- Building Brother Eye, a global monitoring system.
